<LI>Authored a client database in MS Access 95 using Visual Basic For Applications. This involved determining the specifications from the end-users and producing an outline. Considerable communication with users was effected to finalise user requirements.

<LI>The database interfaced with the company’s licence generating program to produce annual licence issues for clients.

<LI>A large number of report-type queries were produced at the request of users. Training was given to several staff members regarding MS Access report generation and modification.

<LI>Utilised Installer Shield Pro v5.0 to write a Windows installation wizard for the PC version of the company’s  main product.
